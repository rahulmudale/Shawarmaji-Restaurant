        <h1>Shawarmaji's Shawarma</h1>
        <h2>
            Shawarmaji was established in 2019 by Pritish, Amey and Rajas in the form of a foodtruck <br> 
            envisioning an expansive spread in the food industry. It began with a simple idea and desire <br>
            to set a mark on the shawarma foodline, making it the most fulfilling serve one may ask for! <br>
            Keeping the customary shawarma, the menu has also expanded keeping the key ingredients in place <br>
            adding a wonderful twist like salads, fusion shawarmas,open shawarmas, grillers and shawarmazza. <br>
            Today, nearly 2.5 years later, they have been able to establish five outlets with a central <br>
            kitchen ranging across Thane and Mumbai
